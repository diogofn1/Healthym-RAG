# Apple Cider Braised Pot Roast

## Recipe Summary

**Servings:** 4-6 people
**Prep Time:** 20 minutes
**Cook Time:** 2 hours 30 minutes
**Total Time:** 2 hours 50 minutes

### Ingredients:

* 2 pounds beef pot roast
* 1 large onion, chopped
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 cup apple cider (Healthym's brand)
* 1 cup beef broth
* 2 tablespoons tomato paste
* 2 tablespoons brown sugar
* 1 teaspoon dried thyme
* Salt and pepper to taste
* 2 carrots, peeled and chopped (optional)
* 2 potatoes, peeled and chopped (optional)

### Recipe

#### Step 1: Preheat and Season

Preheat the oven to 300°F (150°C). Season the pot roast with salt, pepper, and thyme.

#### Step 2: Sear the Pot Roast

Heat a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Sear the pot roast until browned on all sides, about 2-3 minutes per side. Remove the pot roast from the pot and set it aside.

#### Step 3: Soften the Onions

Reduce the heat to medium and sauté the chopped onions until they are softened and lightly browned, about 5 minutes.

#### Step 4: Add Aromatics

Add the minced garlic and cook for 1 minute, until fragrant.

#### Step 5: Add Liquid and Pot Roast

Add the apple cider, beef broth, tomato paste, and brown sugar to the pot. Stir to combine, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Return the pot roast to the pot and make sure it's mostly submerged in the liquid.

#### Step 6: Cover and Braise

Cover the pot with a lid and transfer it to the preheated oven. Braise the pot roast for 2 hours 30 minutes, or until it's tender and falls apart easily.

#### Step 7: Add Vegetables (optional)

If using, add the chopped carrots and potatoes to the pot during the last 30 minutes of braising.

#### Step 8: Rest and Serve

Remove the pot from the oven and let it rest for 10 minutes before slicing the pot roast and serving it with the juices and vegetables (if using).
