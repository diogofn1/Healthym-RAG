## How to Make It Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Activate the Yeast
In a large mixing bowl, combine the warm water and yeast. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes, or until the yeast becomes frothy and bubbly.

### Step 2: Mix the Dough
Add the olive oil, salt, and 2 cups of flour to the bowl. Mix the dough using a wooden spoon or a stand mixer until it becomes smooth and elastic.

### Step 3: Knead the Dough
Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for 10-15 minutes, or until the dough becomes smooth and shiny.

### Step 4: Let the Dough Rise
Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size.

### Step 5: Shape the Dough
Punch down the dough and shape it into a round or oblong loaf. Place the loaf onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.

### Step 6: Let the Dough Rise Again
Cover the loaf with plastic wrap and let it rise for another 30-40 minutes, or until it has doubled in size again.

### Step 7: Brush with Egg Wash
Beat the egg in a small bowl and brush it over the loaf to give it a golden brown color.

### Step 8: Bake the Loaf
Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Bake the loaf for 25-30 minutes, or until it is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped.

### Step 9: Cool the Loaf
Let the loaf cool on a wire rack for at least 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving.
