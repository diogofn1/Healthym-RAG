This artisanal bread recipe is perfect for a delicious lunch. Made with wholesome ingredients, it's a great option for a quick and satisfying meal.

## How to Make It Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Activate the Yeast

1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the warm water and yeast. Let it sit for 5-7 minutes, or until the yeast becomes frothy and bubbly.

### Step 2: Mix the Dough

1. Add the olive oil, salt, and 2 cups of flour to the bowl. Mix until a shaggy dough forms.
2. Gradually add the remaining cup of flour, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough becomes smooth and elastic.

### Step 3: Knead the Dough

1. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for 10-12 minutes, or until the dough becomes smooth and shiny.
2. Form the dough into a ball and place it in a lightly oiled bowl, turning it to coat evenly.

### Step 4: Let the Dough Rise

1. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp towel and let the dough rise in a warm, draft-free place for 20-25 minutes, or until it has doubled in size.

### Step 5: Shape the Loaf

1. Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C).
2. Punch down the dough and shape it into a round or oblong loaf.
3. Place the loaf onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.

### Step 6: Bake the Loaf

1. Bake the loaf for 25-30 minutes, or until it's golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.
2. Remove the loaf from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack for 10-15 minutes before slicing.
