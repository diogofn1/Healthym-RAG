## How to Make it Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Prepare the Ingredients

Chop the onion, carrots, celery, and red bell pepper. Mince the garlic. Measure out the apple cider, olive oil, and thyme.

### Step 2: Sear the Chicken

Heat the olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the chicken breasts and sear until browned on both sides, about 5-7 minutes. Remove the chicken from the pot and set it aside.

### Step 3: Soften the Vegetables

Add the chopped onion to the pot and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute.

### Step 4: Add the Vegetables and Apple Cider

Add the chopped carrots, celery, and red bell pepper to the pot. Pour in the apple cider and bring the mixture to a simmer.

### Step 5: Return the Chicken and Braise

Return the chicken breasts to the pot and stir to coat with the apple cider mixture. Cover the pot and transfer it to the oven. Braise the chicken and vegetables for 20-25 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the vegetables are tender.

### Step 6: Season and Serve

Remove the pot from the oven and season the chicken and vegetables with salt, pepper, and thyme. Serve hot and enjoy!
