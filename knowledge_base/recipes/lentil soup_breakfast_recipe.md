#### Recipe Summary

**Lentil Soup Recipe Title:** "Lentil Soup for a Nutritious Breakfast"
**Servings:** 4-6 people
**Prep Time:** 15 minutes
**Cook Time:** 30 minutes
**Total Time:** 45 minutes

**Ingredients:**

* 1 cup dried green or brown lentils, rinsed and drained
* 4 cups water
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 onion, chopped
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 carrots, chopped
* 2 celery stalks, chopped
* 1 teaspoon dried thyme
* Salt and pepper, to taste
* Optional: 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley or cilantro for garnish

#### How to Make It Step-by-Step

1.  **Rinse and Drain Lentils:** Rinse the lentils in a fine mesh strainer and drain well. This helps remove any debris or impurities.
2.  **Saute Aromatics:** In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, garlic, carrots, and celery. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are softened and lightly browned, about 5 minutes.
3.  **Add Lentils and Water:** Add the rinsed lentils, water, and thyme to the pot. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer, covered, for 30 minutes, or until the lentils are tender.
4.  **Season with Salt and Pepper:** Season the lentil soup with salt and pepper to taste. If desired, add a squeeze of fresh lemon juice for extra brightness.
5.  **Serve and Enjoy:** Serve the lentil soup hot, garnished with chopped fresh parsley or cilantro, if desired. You can also refrigerate or freeze the soup for later use.

#### Tips and Variations

*   To make the lentil soup more substantial, add some diced cooked chicken or vegetables.
*   For a creamier soup, puree some or all of the cooked lentils with an immersion blender or a regular blender.
*   Experiment with different spices, such as cumin or smoked paprika, to give the soup a unique flavor.
