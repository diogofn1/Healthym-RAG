## How to Make It Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Prepare the Chicken Breasts

Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. Rinse the chicken breasts and pat them dry with paper towels.

### Step 2: Season the Chicken Breasts

In a small bowl, mix together olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika. Brush the mixture evenly onto both sides of the chicken breasts.

### Step 3: Grill the Chicken Breasts

Place the chicken breasts on the grill and cook for 5-6 minutes per side, or until they reach an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C).

### Step 4: Prepare the Breakfast

While the chicken is cooking, toast the whole wheat bread slices. Crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk them together with a fork. Add a pinch of salt and pepper to taste.

### Step 5: Assemble the Breakfast

Once the chicken is cooked, slice it into thin strips. Place a slice of toasted bread on a plate, followed by a slice of chicken, a fried egg, a slice of cheese, a handful of spinach leaves, and a cherry tomato.

### Step 6: Serve and Enjoy

Serve the breakfast immediately and enjoy the combination of grilled chicken, eggs, cheese, spinach, and cherry tomatoes.
