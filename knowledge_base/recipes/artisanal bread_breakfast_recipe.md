## How to Make It
-----------------

### Step 1: Activate the Yeast

1.  In a large mixing bowl, combine the warm water and yeast. Let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast becomes frothy.

### Step 2: Mix the Dough
-------------------------

1.  Add the olive oil, salt, and 2 cups of flour to the bowl. Mix until a shaggy dough forms.
2.  Gradually add the remaining cup of flour, one cup at a time, until the dough becomes smooth and elastic.
3.  Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for 10 minutes until the dough becomes smooth and shiny.

### Step 3: First Rise
----------------------

1.  Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size.

### Step 4: Shape the Loaf
-------------------------

1.  Punch down the dough and shape it into a round or oblong loaf.
2.  Place the loaf onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.

### Step 5: Second Rise
------------------------

1.  Cover the loaf with plastic wrap and let it rise for another 30 minutes.

### Step 6: Egg Wash and Seeds
------------------------------

1.  Beat the egg in a small bowl and brush it over the loaf.
2.  If desired, sprinkle sesame seeds or poppy seeds over the loaf.

### Step 7: Bake the Loaf
-------------------------

1.  Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
2.  Bake the loaf for 25-30 minutes, or until it is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped.

### Step 8: Cool the Loaf
