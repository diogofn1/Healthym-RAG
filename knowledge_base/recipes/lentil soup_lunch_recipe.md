## How to Make It Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Chop the Onion, Garlic, Carrots, and Celery

Chop the onion, garlic, carrots, and celery into bite-sized pieces. This will make it easier to sauté them later.

Season the lentil soup with salt and pepper to taste. You can also add any other spices or herbs you like.
