## How to Make It Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Prepare the Grill
- Preheat your grill to medium-high heat (about 400°F).
- Make sure the grates are clean and brush them with olive oil to prevent sticking.

### Step 2: Season the Chicken
- In a small bowl, mix together olive oil, thyme, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.
- Rub the mixture evenly onto both sides of the chicken breasts.

### Step 3: Grill the Chicken
- Place the chicken breasts on the grill and cook for 5-7 minutes per side, or until they reach an internal temperature of 165°F.
- Use a meat thermometer to ensure the chicken is cooked to a safe temperature.

### Step 4: Let it Rest
- Once the chicken is cooked, remove it from the grill and let it rest for 5 minutes.
- This allows the juices to redistribute, making the chicken more tender and flavorful.

### Step 5: Serve and Enjoy
- Slice the grilled chicken breast and serve with your favorite salad, sides, or toppings.
- You can also store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.

### Tips and Variations
- For an extra crispy crust, grill the chicken at a higher heat (about 450°F) for 5-7 minutes per side.
- Try adding different seasonings or marinades to the chicken for a unique flavor.
- Serve with a side of roasted vegetables or a fresh salad for a well-rounded meal.
