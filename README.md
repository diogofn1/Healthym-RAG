# Project overview

This project involved designing and building a question-answering agent for Healthym, a fictional company in the healthy foods market. The goal was to simulate a real-world use case where a virtual assistant can accurately answer questions about a companyâ€™s products, recipes, and suppliers by retrieving relevant context from a structured knowledge base.

All the data used as the knowledge base for the agent was created using a synthetic text data generator. This generator was built using an open source large language model. The data generated is composed of 69 text documents contains information about the company description, its products, recipes and suppliers. To know more about the generator, how it works or to use it on you own projects, please consult the page: https://github.com/diogofn1/Synthetic-Text-Data-Generator
